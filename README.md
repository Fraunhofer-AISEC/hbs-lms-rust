# Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures
LMS implementation in Rust according to the [IETF RFC 8554](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8554).
This implementation is binary compatible with the reference implementation found here: [hash-sigs](https://github.com/cisco/hash-sigs).

This crate does not require the standard library (i.e. no_std capable) and can be easily used for bare-metal programming.

## Demo
A demo application is located in the `examples` folder to demonstrate the use of the library.
This demo application can be used in the console as follows:

```
# Key generation
# Generates `mykey.priv`, `mykey.pub` with merkle tree height 10 and winternitz parameter 2
cargo run --release --example lms-demo -- genkey mykey 10/2

# Signing
# Generates `message.txt.sig`
cargo run --release --example lms-demo -- sign mykey message.txt

# Signing (fast_verification)
# Generates `message.txt_mut`, `message.txt_mut.sig`
HBS_LMS_MAX_HASH_OPTIMIZATIONS=1000 HBS_LMS_THREADS=2 cargo run --release --example lms-demo \
    --features fast_verify -- sign_mut mykey message.txt

# Verification
# Verifies `message.txt` with `message.txt.sig` against `mykey.pub`
cargo run --release --example lms-demo -- verify mykey message.txt
```

## Naming conventions wrt to the IETF RFC
The naming in the RFC is done by using a single character.
To allow for a better understanding of the implementation, we have decided to use more descriptive designations.
The following table shows the mapping between the RFC and the library naming including a short description.

| RFC Naming | Library Naming       | Meaning                                                   |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| I          | lms_tree_identifier  | 16-byte random value to identify a single LMS tree        |
| q          | lms_leaf_identifier  | 4-byte value to identify all leafs in a single LMS tree   |
| C          | signature_randomizer | 32-byte random value added to every signature             |
| Q          | message_hash         | Output of hashed message together with I, q, D_MESG and C |
| y          | signature_data       | The actual data of the signature                          |
| p          | hash_chain_count     | The number of hash chains for a certain W parameter       |
| ls         | checksum_left_shift  | How many bits the checksum is shifted into the coef-value |
| n          | hash_function_output_size | Number of bytes that the lm_ots hash functions generates         |
| m          | hash_function_output_size | Number of bytes that the lms hash functions generates         |
